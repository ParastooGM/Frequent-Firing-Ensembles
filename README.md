# Frequent-Firing-Ensembles
This Dash App is designed to find relationships between neuronal firings in mice brains and social behavior (IB), by using data mining algorithms (the FPgrowth algorithm) and Association rules. The first two tables analyze the IB-Cells interactions and the last two tables analyze the cell patterns. Their respective preprocessed datasets are provided in addition to the source code.
